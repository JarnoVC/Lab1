    <h3>Jarno</h3>
    <p>I'm pretty excited to see what i can achieve with this class, pushing myself to become better at progamming. I'm
        still pretty new to programming so i'm a bit nervous of the steep learning curve which i'm hoping i'll be able to overcome.

    <p>I am looking forward to work a project around donuts. I love to eat donuts! Besides, I want to learn more about websockets and creating
        an own crypto currency or something else with blockchain!
